# Electron Hex clock

A re-make of my hex clock app.
_[Old Clock - https://github.com/NolanKingdon/hex-clock](https://github.com/NolanKingdon/hex-clock)_

 Old clock would run on my desktop using the browser, which added an unappealing browser wrapper. This solves that problem by creating its own wrapper without the frame, making it more aesthetic.

As a benefit, this electron app remains on top of other applications, increasing its visibility.

Just electron and vanilla JavaScript
