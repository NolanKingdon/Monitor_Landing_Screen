# Monitor Home Screen

An extension of my old clock app:
_[Old Clock - https://github.com/NolanKingdon/hex-clock](https://github.com/NolanKingdon/hex-clock)_

Added modules to help minimize the amount of windows I Have open elsewhere on my monitor. Helps to organize my desktop.

## Modules

* Todo list - connects to firebase to display current Todo's across several screens in my home
* Launchpad - Communicates with Node's exec module to run commands. Used to open files/folders and power off the computer
* Youtube Player - Streams music from youtube and displays the current video title.
* Time - Currently a conglomerate of time related modules. Includes Date/Time, and Timer. Alarm build currently in progress
* System Information - Displays relevant system information about processor, RAM, Display, and Mounted Drives

More detailed description of each module and it's functions to come.
